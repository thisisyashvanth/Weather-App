/*
    Never expose API_KEY in the codebase. Keep it private at all times.
    Add sensitive files (like config.js containing API keys) to .gitignore to prevent them from being committed.
    For showcasing projects on GitHub, create a config.example.js file with placeholder values.
    Commit and push the example file publicly, while keeping the actual config.js file hidden.
    Since this is a demo project, exposing API_KEY publicly in GitHub for deployment purposes.
